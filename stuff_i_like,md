<i class="fa-brands fa-app-store-ios"></i> **Apps + Services** 
- [Gmail](https://gmail.com) - After years of trying to avoid Gmail for many reasons, I finally have given in. It's so integrated with so many other products that I love that it was just easier. Almost a version of the power of the default.
- [Dropbox](https://Dropbox.com) - Dropbox is one of the cloud services I use to store files. I find it the best when sharing content with others. On top of that it also hosts all my website files. 
- [Google Drive/Docs/Sheets](https://drive.google.com) - I use Google productivity apps when I need to work with others because it's best at it.
- [Blot.im](https://blot.im) - Where this site is hosted! 
- [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com) - An iOS/Mac app where all my text starts. I use this app to to create posts for this site, compose e-mails, store links, make lists, and as my scratchpad. There is nothing it can''t do with text. 
- [Spotify](https://spotify.com) - I keep going back and forth with Apple Music, while I don't like how Spotify pushes podcasts and books their playlist curation is so much better than other options. So for now, we go Spotify.
- [Overcast](https://overcast.fm) - Speaking of podcasts, this has been my favorite podcast app on iOS for years. I have kept up with Pocketcasts which is also good, and the built in Apple Podcasts app has come a long way. That said, I keep going back to Overcast. 
- [Inoreader](https://www.inoreader.com) - The best RSS service around. 
- [Reeder](https://reederapp.com/) - on iOS I access Inoreader with this app. 
- [Instapaper](https://instapaper.com) - I have used a lot of Read Later apps, but for now I am using Instapaper. With Mozilla shutting down Pocket I went back and I am happy to see the app has gotten a lot of love.
- [Apple Journal](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/journal/id6447391597) - The built in Apple Journal app is great for what it is sold as, a journal! I have a reminder setup twice a day to write and it's been a great new tool for me.
- [MyFitnessPal](https://MyFitnessPal.com) - A calorie counting app I have used for years. It does the job. 
- [Strava](https://Strava.com) - The way I track my outdoor runs
- [Raindrop](https://raindrop.io) - My choice for saving links
- [Apple Notes](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/notes/id1110145109) - The updates over the last few years have made this a great app. Drafts is my default notes app for texts, but Apple Notes is where anything I share with others or has an attachment goes.
- [Todoist](https://todoist.com) - While Apple Reminders has gotten much better, my favorite To do app is still todoist. I have used it on and off for well over a decade, and it's great integration with Gmail is one of the main reasons I gave into using it. 
- [Textastic](https://www.textasticapp.com/) - My favorite text editor on iOS.
