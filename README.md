# Website

This repository is for the website hosted at my personal domain, [darrencohen.me](https://darrencohen.me)

I created it on an HP PC running Linux Mint - XFCE using vscode with an assist from OpenAI's Codex. I will keep the blog updated using VIM on my Linux machine and a combination of Drafts and Working Copy on iOS.
