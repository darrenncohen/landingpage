This page is a quick snapshot of what I am currently using, reading, and listening to.

## Apps and Services

Use this section for tools you currently rely on and why.

- **Personal E-Mail: Gmail**  
  Why I use it: I have recently switched after years of avoiding Gmail. I was a fastmail user with a custom domain, but I really started missing out on potential integrations that work best with Google or Microsoft. I am using the consumer gmail with the @gmail.com address as to use custom domain with google workspace changes certain things the accounts give you. 
- **Storage: Google Drive/Dropbox**  
  Why I use it: I am using both, but majority of the time I am using Google Drive for the same reason above. Dropbox has it's advantages for certain things so I keep both around. As noted above I am spending a lot of time on Linux these days, and the Dropbox integration into the system is better. 
- **Quick Notes: Google Keep**
  Why I use it: It's the easiest way to get information quickly from my Laptop to my phone and does a good job with simple lists. The recent addition of Google Tasks into Keep really makes this even more useful.
  **Long Notes: Apple Notes**
  Why I use it: It is so integrated into the iPhone and has made storing documents and other things easy.
- **Bookmark Manager: Raindrop.io**
  Why I use it: I have never used a better service for keeping all my bookmarks organized. Given I use multiple platforms it also makes switching browsers easy.
