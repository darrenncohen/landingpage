This page is a quick snapshot of what I am currently using, reading, and listening to.

## Apps and Services

Use this section for tools you currently rely on and why.

- **Personal E-Mail: Fastmail**  
  Why I use it: I have been a Fastmail user for well over a decade for a reason. It's a neutral platform that respects web stardards like imap and caldav. This means I can use the Fastmail app if I want, but it works just as well with everything else. On my iPhone I use the built in iOS mail app with the Calendar app while on my laptop I use Fastmail on the web. It all just works. 
- **Storage: Dropbox**  
  Why I use it: Similar to Fastmail, Dropbox is the most neutral of the storage services. They do a great job of making sure their stuff works whereever you are. That does not mean I don't use iCloud for certain things as well as Google Drive for others. My first choice though is Dropbox.
  **Notes: Apple Notes**
  Why I use it: Over the last few years the updates to Apple Notes have turned into a powerhouse. Even the [icloud.com](https://icloud.com) web home works pretty well for when I need to see something. It also does a great job storing pdf's, images, etc.
- **Bookmark Manager: Raindrop.io**
  Why I use it: I have never used a better service for keeping all my bookmarks organized. Given I use multiple platforms it also makes switching browsers easy.
