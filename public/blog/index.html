I know he is young, but was still a shock to read.</p></p></div><div class=post><h2 class=post-title><a href=/blog/coffee-as-a-treatment/>🔗 Coffee as a Treatment</a></h2><p class=meta>Feb 1, 2026 · 7:45am</p><p><blockquote><p>The study has not yet been published. But MindBio’s CEO Justin Hanka recently released the top-line results on his LinkedIn, eager to show that his company was “in front of the curve in microdosing research.” He called it “the most vigorous placebo controlled trial ever performed in microdosing.” It found that patients dosed with a small amount of LSD (ranging from 4 to 20μg, or micrograms, well below the threshold of a mind-blowing hallucinogenic dose) showed observable upticks in feelings of well-being, but worse MADRS scores, compared to patients given a placebo in the form of a caffeine pill. (Because patients in psychedelic trials typically expect some kind of mind-altering effect, studies are often blinded using so-called “active placebos,” like caffeine or methylphenidate, which have their own observable psychoactive properties.)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>This means, essentially, that a medium-strength cup of coffee may prove more beneficial in treating major depressive disorder than a tiny dose of acid. Good news for habitual caffeine users, perhaps, but less so for researchers (and biopharma startups) counting on the efficacy of psychedelic microdosing.</p></blockquote><p>—</p><p>Well given the amount of coffee I drink, I will approve of this study. Will take any help I can get. Also, someone tell Elon!</p></p></div><div class=post><h2 class=post-title><a href=/blog/the-rip-review/>The Rip on Netflix</a></h2><p class=meta>Jan 26, 2026 · 12:00am</p><p><p><img src=/img/the_rip_review.png alt="review of the rip on netflix, rated decent"></p></p></div><div class=post><h2 class=post-title><a href=/blog/no-such-thing/>🔗 There is no Such Thing as Other People's Children</a></h2><p class=meta>Jan 25, 2026 · 12:00am</p><p><blockquote><p>They made a mistake in picking Minneapolis. They came here believing that the same old lines of division that animate their entire political project&ndash;race, culture, class&ndash;would be reason enough to keep people in their homes while they went about their violent work. Instead we are out there in every place they are, showing them that every person in this city is one of our own, that there is no such thing as other people&rsquo;s children, that collectively we are not afraid of staring them in the eye. They can sense this.</p></blockquote><hr><p>The line from the piece that also is used as the title should be humanity&rsquo;s guiding direction, but we have seen over and over again the philosophy of the global right is not only to not believe this, it&rsquo;s that actively hurting others is the only way one gets ahead.</p></p></div><div class=post><h2 class=post-title><a href=/blog/mets-zips-2026/>🔗 2026 ZiPS Projections: New York Mets</a></h2><p class=meta>Jan 23, 2026 · 10:00am</p><p><blockquote><p>Despite last season’s collapse, ZiPS projects the Mets as a highly competitive team in the NL East, and one the league shouldn’t dismiss</p></blockquote><p>I know it might not feel like it, but the Mets are better today than they were on the last day of the season.</p></p></div></div></article><footer class=footer><p><small>© 2026 Darren Cohen · Built with
